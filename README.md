A Concourse resource for pull requests on Github. Written in Go and based on the [Github V4 (GraphQL) API][graphql-api].

This is based on the latest [telia-oss/github-pr-resource](https://github.com/telia-oss/github-pr-resource), but with a few features on top:

- on-disk HTTP caching of GitHub API calls ([7d31bf1](https://github.com/opendoor-labs/github-pr-resource/commit/7d31bf1))
- adds `status_filter` field used on a few of our pipelines (#2)
- fixes pagination date bug (#6)

telia-oss/github-pr-resource is itself inspired by [the original][original-resource], with some important differences:

- Github V4: `check` only requires 1 API call per 100th *open* pull request. (See [#costs](#costs) for more information).
- Fetch/merge: `get` will always merge a specific commit from the Pull request into the latest base.
- Metadata: `get` and `put` provides information about which commit (SHA) was used from both the PR and base.
- Webhooks: Does not implement any caching thanks to GraphQL, which means it works well with webhooks.

Notes:
 - If `v3_endpoint` is set, `v4_endpoint` must also be set (and the other way around).
 - Look at the [Concourse Resources documentation](https://concourse-ci.org/resources.html#resource-webhook-token)
 for webhook token configuration.
 - When using `required_review_approvals`, you may also want to enable GitHub's branch protection rules to [dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed](https://help.github.com/en/articles/enabling-required-reviews-for-pull-requests).

## Behaviour

#### `check`

Produces new versions for all commits (after the last version) ordered by the committed date.
A version is represented as follows:

- `pr`: The pull request number.
- `commit`: The commit SHA.
- `committed`: Timestamp of when the commit was committed. Used to filter subsequent checks.
- `approved_review_count`: The number of reviews approving of the PR.

If several commits are pushed to a given PR at the same time, the last commit will be the new version.

**Note on webhooks:**
This resource does not implement any caching, so it should work well with webhooks (should be subscribed to `push` and `pull_request` events).
One thing to keep in mind however, is that pull requests that are opened from a fork and commits to said fork will not
generate notifications over the webhook. So if you have a repository with little traffic and expect pull requests from forks,
 you'll need to discover those versions with `check_every: 1m` for instance. `check` in this resource is not a costly operation,
 so normally you should not have to worry about the rate limit.

#### `get`

| Parameter            | Required | Example  | Description                                                                        |
|----------------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `skip_download`      | No       | `true`   | Use with `get_params` in a `put` step to do nothing on the implicit get.           |
| `integration_tool`   | No       | `rebase` | The integration tool to use, `merge`, `rebase` or `checkout`. Defaults to `merge`. |
| `git_depth`          | No       | `1`      | Shallow clone the repository using the `--depth` Git option                        |
| `submodules`       | No       | `true` | Recursively clone git submodules. Defaults to false.                        |
| `list_changed_files` | No       | `true`   | Generate a list of changed files and save alongside metadata                       |
| `fetch_tags`       | No       | `true`     | Fetch tags from remote repository                                                  |

Clones the base (e.g. `master` branch) at the latest commit, and merges the pull request at the specified commit
into master. This ensures that we are both testing and setting status on the exact commit that was requested in
input. Because the base of the PR is not locked to a specific commit in versions emitted from `check`, a fresh
`get` will always use the latest commit in master and *report the SHA of said commit in the metadata*. Both the
requested version and the metadata emitted by `get` are available to your tasks as JSON:
- `.git/resource/version.json`
- `.git/resource/metadata.json`
- `.git/resource/changed_files` (if enabled by `list_changed_files`)

The information in `metadata.json` is also available as individual files in the `.git/resource` directory, e.g. the `base_sha`
is available as `.git/resource/base_sha`. For a complete list of available (individual) metadata files, please check the code
[here](https://github.com/telia-oss/github-pr-resource/blob/master/in.go#L66).

When specifying `skip_download` the pull request volume mounted to subsequent tasks will be empty, which is a problem
when you set e.g. the pending status before running the actual tests. The workaround for this is to use an alias for
the `put` (see https://github.com/telia-oss/github-pr-resource/issues/32 for more details).
Example here:

```yaml
put: update-status <-- Use an alias for the pull-request resource
resource: pull-request
params:
    path: pull-request
    status: pending
get_params: {skip_download: true}
```

git-crypt encrypted repositories will automatically be decrypted when the `git_crypt_key` is set in the source configuration.

Note that, should you retrigger a build in the hopes of testing the last commit to a PR against a newer version of
the base, Concourse will reuse the volume (i.e. not trigger a new `get`) if it still exists, which can produce
unexpected results (#5). As such, re-testing a PR against a newer version of the base is best done by *pushing an
empty commit to the PR*.


#### `put`

| Parameter                  | Required | Example                              | Description                                                                                                                                                   |

## Costs

The Github API(s) have a rate limit of 5000 requests per hour (per user). For the V3 API this essentially
translates to 5000 requests, whereas for the V4 API (GraphQL)  the calculation is more involved:
https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/resource-limitations/#calculating-a-rate-limit-score-before-running-the-call

Ref the above, here are some examples of running `check` against large repositories and the cost of doing so:
- [concourse/concourse](https://github.com/concourse/concourse): 51 open pull requests at the time of testing. Cost 2.
- [torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux): 305 open pull requests. Cost 8.
- [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes): 1072 open pull requests. Cost: 22.

For the other two operations the costing is a bit easier:
- `get`: Fixed cost of 1. Fetches the pull request at the given commit.
- `put`: Uses the V3 API and has a min cost of 1, +1 for each of `status`, `comment` and `comment_file` etc.

## Migrating

If you are coming from [jtarchie/github-pullrequest-resource][original-resource], its important to know that this resource is inspired by *but not a drop-in replacement for* the original. Here are some important differences:

#### New parameters:
- `source`:
  - `v4_endpoint` (see description above)
- `put`:
  - `comment` (see description above)

#### Parameters that have been renamed:
- `source`:
  - `repo` -> `repository`
  - `ci_skip` -> `disable_ci_skip` (the logic has been inverted and its `true` by default)
  - `api_endpoint` -> `v3_endpoint`
  - `base` -> `base_branch`
  - `base_url` -> `target_url`
  - `require_review_approval` -> `required_review_approvals` (`bool` to `int`)
- `get`:
  - `git.depth` -> `git_depth`
- `put`:
  - `comment` -> `comment_file` (because we added `comment`)

#### Parameters that are no longer needed:
- `src`:
  - `uri`: We fetch the URI directly from the Github API instead.
  - `private_key`: We clone over HTTPS using the access token for authentication.
  - `username`: Same as above
  - `password`: Same as above
  - `only_mergeable`: We are opinionated and simply fail to `get` if it does not merge.
- `get`:
  - `fetch_merge`: We are opinionated and always do a fetch_merge.

#### Parameters that did not make it:
- `src`:
  - `authorship_restriction`
  - `label`
  - `git_config`: You can now get the pr/author info from .git/resource/metadata.json instead
- `get`:
  - `git.*` (with the exception of `git_depth`, see above)
- `put`:
  - `merge.*`
  - `label`

Note that if you are migrating from the original resource on a Concourse version prior to `v5.0.0`, you might
see an error `failed to unmarshal request: json: unknown field "ref"`. The solution is to rename the resource
so that the history is wiped. See [#64](https://github.com/telia-oss/github-pr-resource/issues/64) for details.

## Debugging

The following query is useful for debugging with the github
graphql explorer

```graphql
# Type queries into this side of the screen, and you will
# see intelligent typeaheads aware of the current GraphQL type schema,
# live syntax, and validation errors highlighted within the text.

# We'll get you started with a simple query showing your username!
query {
  repository(name: "code", owner: "opendoor-labs") {
    pullRequests(first: 100) {
      edges {
        node {
          commits(last: 1) {
            edges {
              node {
                commit {
                  status {
                    contexts {
                      context
                      createdAt
                      state
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```


#### Clone/Fetch
Clone/fetch is defaulted to a `git_depth` : `1`
This will double up to a `MaxDepth` if we can't find a common ancestor
